        <p class="hero-lead">
          “No annual fee” is a simple message, but card pricing is more complex. This page explains how issuers structure annual fees, FX fees, interest and other charges on no-fee and low-fee cards — in neutral, documentation-style language.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does “No Annual Fee” Actually Cover?</h2>
      <p>When a card is advertised as having “no annual fee”, it usually means that the issuer does not charge a recurring yearly fee simply for holding the account. This can apply for the entire life of the product or only for an introductory period.</p>
      <p>However, the absence of an annual fee does not remove other charges. Pricing tables still list interest rates, FX margins, cash-advance fees, late fees and potentially balance-transfer or installment fees. Reading the full schedule is the only way to see the complete structure.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics / fee types -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Types of Fees Around a No-Fee Card</h2>
      <p>No-fee and low-fee products often adjust multiple dimensions of pricing at once. Common components include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Annual fee</strong> – set to zero, discounted for the first year, or waived under certain usage conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase APR</strong> – interest rate charged on carried purchase balances after any grace period.</li>
        <li><strong>FX fees</strong> – percentage markup on foreign-currency transactions, even when annual fees are zero.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash-advance fees</strong> – charges for ATM withdrawals or similar, often higher on no-fee cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Penalty fees</strong> – late payment or returned payment fees as defined in the agreement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Product comparisons usually highlight the annual fee first, but documentation treats all of these elements as part of the same pricing framework.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How No-Fee Cards Trade Features for Pricing</h2>
      <p>Removing an annual fee can be balanced by changes elsewhere in the product design. Documentation may show:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Lower reward earn rates than comparable cards with annual fees.</li>
        <li>Fewer bundled benefits, such as travel insurance or lounge access.</li>
        <li>Higher FX fees on foreign transactions.</li>
        <li>Different introductory APR offers or shorter promotional periods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These trade-offs vary by issuer and market. The goal here is not to rank products, but to highlight which parts of the documentation describe those differences.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Introductory Waivers vs. Permanent No-Fee</h2>
      <p>Some cards are permanently no-fee, while others waive the annual fee only for a set period. Typical patterns include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>First-year free</strong> – the annual fee is waived for the first year and then charged from year two onward.</li>
        <li><strong>Spend-based waivers</strong> – the fee is waived if you meet a spending threshold within a year.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship waivers</strong> – the fee is waived if you hold certain other products with the same institution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Terms and conditions explain how long waivers last, what happens if thresholds are not met, and how changes are communicated over time.</p>
